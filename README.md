# Minimatica

Minimatica is a WIP project for the web-development class at university.
It's a small interpreted language capable of rather basic mathematical
computation. As soon as a reference is available, I will add a link to
it here.

## Try It for Yourself

Download the repository and use the terminal to navigate to the root
directory of the project. Run `$ npm install` to fetch all node dependencies.

To start the parcel live development server, run `$ npm test`. Given that port
1234 is available on your host, you can then navigate to `localhost:1234` in
using your browser to try out the minimatica language. Parcel will also let you
know which port the server is running on in case 1234 is not available.
